Great! Here's exactly what you need to do from your **VS Code terminal** (or any terminal) inside your project folder `pollution_forecasting`:

---

### ✅ Step-by-step commands:

```bash
cd pollution_forecasting         # Navigate to your project folder (if not already in it)

rmdir /s /q env                  # Delete the old virtual environment named 'env'

python -m venv venv             # Create a new virtual environment named 'venv'

.\venv\Scripts\activate         # Activate the new virtual environment (PowerShell)

pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install all packages from requirements.txt
```

---

### ❗ Notes:

* If you're using **Command Prompt** instead of PowerShell, use:

  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

In your **data science / ML project**, this `DataIngestionArtifact` class is used to **cleanly pass the output paths of the data ingestion step** to the next stages in the pipeline (like data transformation or training). Let’s break it down:

---

### ✅ What the code does:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DataIngestionArtifact:
    training_file_path: str
    testing_file_path: str
```

This uses the `@dataclass` decorator to **automatically create a simple class** that holds two attributes:

* `training_file_path`: path to the train dataset file.
* `testing_file_path`: path to the test dataset file.

---

### ✅ Why it's useful in ML projects:

1. **Structured Output**
   After your *data ingestion* step (e.g., reading raw data, cleaning, and splitting into train/test), you return a `DataIngestionArtifact` object instead of just strings or dictionaries.

2. **Cleaner Code**
   Instead of manually tracking file paths throughout your pipeline, you can use:

   ```python
   artifact = DataIngestionArtifact(training_file_path='path/to/train.csv', testing_file_path='path/to/test.csv')
   ```

3. **Improves Readability and Maintainability**
   When passing artifacts between pipeline components (e.g., ingestion → transformation → training), it’s clear and consistent what each step returns or expects.

4. **Reduces Bugs**
   Since attributes are explicitly defined with types, you catch mistakes early (e.g., accidentally passing a wrong file path).

---

### ✅ Example Usage in Pipeline:

```python
def run_data_ingestion() -> DataIngestionArtifact:
    # perform ingestion and save train/test files
    train_path = "artifacts/train.csv"
    test_path = "artifacts/test.csv"
    return DataIngestionArtifact(training_file_path=train_path, testing_file_path=test_path)

artifact = run_data_ingestion()
print(artifact.training_file_path)  # Use in transformation step
```

---

### ✅ Summary:

`DataIngestionArtifact` is a lightweight, structured object to **store and transfer output paths** from the data ingestion step, making your ML pipeline more modular, readable, and reliable.
