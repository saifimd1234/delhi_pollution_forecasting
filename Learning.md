Great! Here's exactly what you need to do from your **VS Code terminal** (or any terminal) inside your project folder `pollution_forecasting`:

---

### ✅ Step-by-step commands:

```bash
cd pollution_forecasting         # Navigate to your project folder (if not already in it)

rmdir /s /q env                  # Delete the old virtual environment named 'env'

python -m venv venv             # Create a new virtual environment named 'venv'

.\venv\Scripts\activate         # Activate the new virtual environment (PowerShell)

pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install all packages from requirements.txt
```

---

### ❗ Notes:

* If you're using **Command Prompt** instead of PowerShell, use:

  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

In your **data science / ML project**, this `DataIngestionArtifact` class is used to **cleanly pass the output paths of the data ingestion step** to the next stages in the pipeline (like data transformation or training). Let’s break it down:

---

### ✅ What the code does:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DataIngestionArtifact:
    training_file_path: str
    testing_file_path: str
```

This uses the `@dataclass` decorator to **automatically create a simple class** that holds two attributes:

* `training_file_path`: path to the train dataset file.
* `testing_file_path`: path to the test dataset file.

---

### ✅ Why it's useful in ML projects:

1. **Structured Output**
   After your *data ingestion* step (e.g., reading raw data, cleaning, and splitting into train/test), you return a `DataIngestionArtifact` object instead of just strings or dictionaries.

2. **Cleaner Code**
   Instead of manually tracking file paths throughout your pipeline, you can use:

   ```python
   artifact = DataIngestionArtifact(training_file_path='path/to/train.csv', testing_file_path='path/to/test.csv')
   ```

3. **Improves Readability and Maintainability**
   When passing artifacts between pipeline components (e.g., ingestion → transformation → training), it’s clear and consistent what each step returns or expects.

4. **Reduces Bugs**
   Since attributes are explicitly defined with types, you catch mistakes early (e.g., accidentally passing a wrong file path).

---

### ✅ Example Usage in Pipeline:

```python
def run_data_ingestion() -> DataIngestionArtifact:
    # perform ingestion and save train/test files
    train_path = "artifacts/train.csv"
    test_path = "artifacts/test.csv"
    return DataIngestionArtifact(training_file_path=train_path, testing_file_path=test_path)

artifact = run_data_ingestion()
print(artifact.training_file_path)  # Use in transformation step
```

---

### ✅ Summary:

`DataIngestionArtifact` is a lightweight, structured object to **store and transfer output paths** from the data ingestion step, making your ML pipeline more modular, readable, and reliable.

---

## ✅ Purpose of This Code:

It defines configuration classes that store all file paths, folder structures, and metadata related to:

* The overall training pipeline.
* The data ingestion step.

These configurations help keep the pipeline **modular**, **organized**, and **easy to manage**, especially when working with large ML projects.

---

## 🔹 `TrainingPipelineConfig` class

### Purpose:

Stores basic info for the **entire training pipeline**, such as:

* Name of the pipeline
* Timestamp (used to version the run)
* Where to store artifacts (outputs of each pipeline step)
* Final model directory

### What It Does:

```python
timestamp=timestamp.strftime("%m_%d_%Y_%H_%M_%S")
self.artifact_dir=os.path.join(self.artifact_name,timestamp)
```

This creates a **versioned directory** like:

```
artifacts/09_14_2024_15_35_10/
```

So that every pipeline run is saved in a separate folder.

---

## 🔹 `DataIngestionConfig` class

### Purpose:

Stores configuration specific to **data ingestion**, like:

* Paths to feature store, train and test files
* Train-test split ratio
* MongoDB collection/database names

### Key Components:

```python
self.data_ingestion_dir = os.path.join(training_pipeline_config.artifact_dir, training_pipeline.DATA_INGESTION_DIR_NAME)
```

This organizes data ingestion outputs under something like:

```
artifacts/09_14_2024_15_35_10/data_ingestion/
```

### Outputs:

* `feature_store_file_path`: Raw/cleaned data before splitting
* `training_file_path`, `testing_file_path`: Where to save split files
* `train_test_split_ratio`: Used to split your data (e.g., 0.8 train / 0.2 test)
* `collection_name`, `database_name`: For fetching data from MongoDB

---

## ✅ Why This is Important in a Real Project

1. **Centralized control**: You define all paths/settings in one place.
2. **Reusability**: Other pipeline components (e.g., transformation, training) can easily access these paths/configs.
3. **Versioning**: Timestamped folders help manage multiple runs without overwriting.
4. **Clean Code**: Keeps logic separate from configuration.

---

## ✅ Summary

This code is setting up the **config blueprint** for your ML pipeline:

| Class                    | Purpose                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TrainingPipelineConfig` | Top-level pipeline info like artifact folder and model save path |
| `DataIngestionConfig`    | Specific to ingestion: file paths, split ratio, MongoDB details  |
